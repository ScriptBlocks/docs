# Chapter 4: Variables

Variables store information that can be used and manipulated in a program. In Python, you assign a value to a variable using the `=` sign.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.7
```

Here, `name`, `age`, and `height` are variables storing a string, an integer, and a float, respectively.
