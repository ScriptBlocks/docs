# Chapter 6: If Statements

`If` statements allow your program to make decisions based on conditions.

## Example

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not an adult.")
```

This code checks if `age` is 18 or more and prints the appropriate message.
