# Chapter 28: Introduction to Virtual Environments

Virtual environments allow you to manage dependencies for different projects separately.

## Example

```bash
$ python -m venv myenv
$ source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Your shell will now indicate that the virtual environment is active.
